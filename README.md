# Overview

Ephemeral Google Chrome in a Docker container useful for testing websites. Sometimes it's hard to clean caches (DNS, caching proxies, etc) but this is a browser environment that's completely clean every time.

NOTE: This is intended to be used on Linux desktop systems -- no idea how to get it working on another OS because this is itended to be used with X Window System or Wayland. There's a few tweaks to harden security, if you have any problems please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/MaxMilton/Ephemeral-Google-Chrome/issues).

## Requirements

* Docker 1.8+
* X server or Wayland (with xorg-server-xwayland)

## Instructions

You can either customise and build the Docker image yourself, which is a good idea since you'll get the latest version of Google Chrome. Or just run launch-chrome.docker.sh as is to use a pre-built image from Docker Hub.

If you don't want Chrome stable x86_64 version just edit the Dockerfile and build it yourself:

1. Build Docker image (replace with your user name): `docker build --no-cache -t <UserName>/chrome .`
2. Customise the launcher using your favorite editor `vim launch-chrome.docker.sh`
3. Make sure launch-chrome.docker.sh is executable: `chmod +x launch-chrome.docker.sh`
4. Run `launch-chrome.docker.sh`

## Note: Site Blocking

To simulate network issues, you can block access to certain domains. By default YouTube.com and Facebook.com are blocked. Edit domains or remove this blocking in `launch-chrome.docker.sh`.
